# Comments

You can also write comments in the rulebook. These do not contain any logic. They are for information purposes only and are also generated as comments in the generated code. A comment always starts with the keyword `COMMENT`.

```text
COMMENT This is a commentary
```

Comments can also be used for collaborating on rule sets to document change proposals.

Of course, multi-line comments can also be written.

```text
COMMENT This is a commentary
        And here also...
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
For multiline comments, note that under no circumstances should two consecutive line breaks be used.
{% endhint %}
